DSL
`, `
1. The PSTN and ISDN are important to architecture along with ITU-T standards
2. Copper wires have attenuation and limited range(18000 feet length or 5.5km),
limited bandwidth 3400Khz(earlier), crosstalk, limits on bridged taps
64kilobit - 128kilobit limit on ISDN BRI(Basic Rate Interface) or 2.94 Mbps using ISDN PRI(Primary Rate Interface) which uses channels.
BONDING(Bandwidth On Demand Interoperability Group) and Multilink PPP
ISDN is used because - copper wires, remote region, B-ISDN(Broadband ISDN),
better than dial up, uses digital modem,
works using telephone infra,
works for credit card readers, fax
Alternative to ISDN - VoIP Provider over PSTN - ATA(analog telephone terminal adapter), IP Phones, SIP trunking, cost efficient
ISDN is outdated and to be phased out for being inflexible, time consuming and expensive to setup.
ISDN advantages - Bearer services(no manipulation or modification to data, end to end),
Teleservices, Supplementary services, Integrated Services(2 + 1 channels simultaneously ),
Satellite connection, cable TV, banks, ATM, BSNL, ADSL, VDSL, places where QoS does not exist
B channel - bearer, D channel - data
2B + D = 64 * 2 + 16 kilobit/sec - BRA(BRI)
30B + 2D = 2.048Megabit/sec - PRI
3. OSI layers - Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application
4. DSL have speeds of 100Mbps and are also known as "always on connections"
5. DSL Home lists the requirements (created by DSL Forum)
Triple/Quad play services to end user's like voice, video, data, IPTV, Video on Demand(VoD), Content on Demand(CoD)
TR069 of the Broadband Forum
Remote management is core of DSL Home
WT-124 - RG access via xPON and others
TR-122 Voice ATA
Limits of VDSL 55Megabit, VDSL2 100Megabit, ADSL 7Megabit
6. DSL Home TR069
Provisioning of services via auto configuration
ISP needs to have Access Control systems
ACS Captive portal
ISP needs Notification mechanisms
ISP needs Firmware update
Status and performance monitoring
Diagnostics
Remote management via SSL/TLS
TR-111 for End Devices(ED) with STUN RFC 3489
7. Network connectivity problems
DSL cannot train or DSL signal not detected or Broadband Ethernet not connected
ATM PVC not detected
IEE 802.1x failure
PPP server not detected
PPP authentication failure
DHCP not available
8. ADSL block diagram for PHY layer -
Data in, Framing TC, RS encoder, Interleaver, Trellis encoder, QAM, IFFT, Tx-filter, D/A,
Telephone Channel,
 A/D, Rx-filter, FFT, QAM demodulator, Trellis decoder, De interleaver, RS decoder, Framing TC, Data out
9. ADSL2 benefits -
12M data rate, 6000m range, no seamless rate change, Power saving mode, avoid 1bit per bin and partial byte per symbol,
64kbps overhead channel rate(Framing Structure 3)
ADSL2+ benefits -
24M data rate, seamless rate adaptation when SNR change, power management, 1bit per bin, partial byte per symbol increase reach,
variable overhead channel rate meets need, loop diagnostic during training
Higher rates, extended reach, improved stability, power management, enhanced spectral compatibility
Rate enhancement tech - mandatory trellis coding, reduced framing overhead, 1-bit constellations, data on pilot tone
LDSL - long reach DSL
RE-ADSL - reach extended ADSL
Reed solomon coding,
10. VDSL Access Technology
Also known as VADSL, Ansi working group T1E1.4
VDSL is 30x faster than HDSL
VADSL was incorrect as VDSL supports both symmetric and asymmetric
VDSL uses higher frequency in copper than POTS and ISDN for Telco 20khz to 30Mhz and more
passive filters called dispatchers preserve baseband for ISDN
HDTV requires 18Megabits/sec downstream
SONET canonical speed 155.52 Mbps
SDH canonical 51.82, 25.92, 12, 96 Mbps

10. VDSL service sets
Symmetric VDSL 
short haul T1 replacements NXT1 rate
6.48 - 21.92Mbps
Short range 1kft
Medium range 3kft
Long range 4.5kft
between T1(1.5mbps) to T3(44.3mbps)

11. VDSL video service
Digital TV broadcast, VoD, HDTV
WebTV, e-commerce, video games, video conferencing, interactive video
DBS
Internet growth, the ADSL runs out of bandwidth
Internet architecture backbone is shifting to ATM(Asynchronous Transfer Mode ITU-T standard)
ATM is preferred FSAN(Full Service Access Network) backbone
Telephony services - DSL provides POTS always
VoIP and Voice over ATM(VToA)
VoDSL and derived channels
Lifeline services
Deployment Scenarios - FTTX
VDSL is only suitable for FTTEx, FTTN, FTTCab would use standalone deployments or NG-DLC or VDSL switch.
MDU businesses would use FTTB which would end VDSL.
VDSL2 activity is -
5 band 100Megabit/sec activity
CHT telecom, Swisscom, Belgacom, Deutsche telecom, KPN, Telephonica
Bandwidth 14x ADSL2+ and 4096 tones (8x ADSL+)
DMT - Discrete multi tone for VDSL2
dBm - decibell milliwatts
VDSL1 has limit of 14.5dBm for CO deployment and 11.5dBm for cabinet
High tx power like 20.5dBm for 8b profile increase range, FEXT impact and raise dS1 power in PSD
