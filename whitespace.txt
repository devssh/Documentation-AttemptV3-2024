12.2 White Space
White space code points are used to improve source text readability and to separate tokens (indivisible lexical units) from each other, but are otherwise insignificant. White space code points may occur between any two tokens and at the start or end of input. White space code points may occur within a StringLiteral, a RegularExpressionLiteral, a Template, or a TemplateSubstitutionTail where they are considered significant code points forming part of a literal value. They may also occur within a Comment, but cannot appear within any other kind of token.

The ECMAScript white space code points are listed in Table 35.

Table 35: White Space Code Points
Code Points	Name	Abbreviation
U+0009	CHARACTER TABULATION	<TAB>
U+000B	LINE TABULATION	<VT>
U+000C	FORM FEED (FF)	<FF>
U+FEFF	ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE	<ZWNBSP>
any code point in general category “Space_Separator”		<USP>
NOTE 1
U+0020 (SPACE) and U+00A0 (NO-BREAK SPACE) code points are part of <USP>.

NOTE 2
Other than for the code points listed in Table 35, ECMAScript WhiteSpace intentionally excludes all code points that have the Unicode “White_Space” property but which are not classified in general category “Space_Separator” (“Zs”).

12.3 Line Terminators
Like white space code points, line terminator code points are used to improve source text readability and to separate tokens (indivisible lexical units) from each other. However, unlike white space code points, line terminators have some influence over the behaviour of the syntactic grammar. In general, line terminators may occur between any two tokens, but there are a few places where they are forbidden by the syntactic grammar. Line terminators also affect the process of automatic semicolon insertion (12.10). A line terminator cannot occur within any token except a StringLiteral, Template, or TemplateSubstitutionTail. <LF> and <CR> line terminators cannot occur within a StringLiteral token except as part of a LineContinuation.

A line terminator can occur within a MultiLineComment but cannot occur within a SingleLineComment.

Line terminators are included in the set of white space code points that are matched by the \s class in regular expressions.

The ECMAScript line terminator code points are listed in Table 36.

Table 36: Line Terminator Code Points
Code Point	Unicode Name	Abbreviation
U+000A	LINE FEED (LF)	<LF>
U+000D	CARRIAGE RETURN (CR)	<CR>
U+2028	LINE SEPARATOR	<LS>
U+2029	PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR	<PS>
Only the Unicode code points in Table 36 are treated as line terminators. Other new line or line breaking Unicode code points are not treated as line terminators but are treated as white space if they meet the requirements listed in Table 35. The sequence <CR><LF> is commonly used as a line terminator. It should be considered a single SourceCharacter for the purpose of reporting line numbers.

Syntax
LineTerminator ::
<LF>
<CR>
<LS>
<PS>
LineTerminatorSequence ::
<LF>
<CR> [lookahead ≠ <LF>]
<LS>
<PS>
<CR> <LF>
12.4 Comments
Comments can be either single or multi-line. Multi-line comments cannot nest.

Because a single-line comment can contain any Unicode code point except a LineTerminator code point, and because of the general rule that a token is always as long as possible, a single-line comment always consists of all code points from the // marker to the end of the line. However, the LineTerminator at the end of the line is not considered to be part of the single-line comment; it is recognized separately by the lexical grammar and becomes part of the stream of input elements for the syntactic grammar. This point is very important, because it implies that the presence or absence of single-line comments does not affect the process of automatic semicolon insertion (see 12.10).

Comments behave like white space and are discarded except that, if a MultiLineComment contains a line terminator code point, then the entire comment is considered to be a LineTerminator for purposes of parsing by the syntactic grammar.

Unicode also provides some visible characters that can be used to represent various whitespace characters, in contexts where a visible symbol must be displayed:


Unicode
The table below lists the twenty-five characters defined as whitespace ("WSpace=Y", "WS") characters in the Unicode Character Database.[1] Seventeen use a definition of whitespace consistent with the algorithm for bidirectional writing ("Bidirectional Character Type=WS") and are known as "Bidi-WS" characters. The remaining characters may also be used, but are not of this "Bidi" type.

Note: Depending on the browser and fonts used to view the following table, not all spaces may be displayed properly.
