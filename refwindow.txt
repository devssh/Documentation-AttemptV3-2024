 Window The Window interface represents a window containing a DOM document the document property points to the DOM document loaded in that window.
A window for a given document can be obtained using the document.defaultView property.
A global variable window representing the window in which the script is running is exposed to JavaScript code.
The Window interface is home to a variety of functions namespaces objects and constructors which are not necessarily directly associated with the concept of a user interface window.
However the Window interface is a suitable place to include these items that need to be globally available.
Many of these are documented in the JavaScript Reference and the DOM Reference .
In a tabbed browser each tab is represented by its own Window object the global window seen by JavaScript code running within a given tab always represents the tab in which the code is running.
That said even in a tabbed browser some properties and methods still apply to the overall window that contains the tab such as resizeTo() and innerHeight .
Generally anything that cant reasonably pertain to a tab pertains to the window instead.
