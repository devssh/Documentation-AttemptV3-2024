V8 first generates an abstract syntax tree with its own parser. 
Then, Ignition generates bytecode from this syntax tree using the internal V8 bytecode format
TurboFan compiles this bytecode into machine code. 
In other words, V8 compiles ECMAScript directly to native machine code using just-in-time compilation before executing it.
The compiled code is additionally optimized (and re-optimized) dynamically at runtime,
based on heuristics of the code's execution profile.
Optimization techniques used include inlining, elision of expensive runtime properties, and inline caching.
The garbage collector is a generational incremental collector.
